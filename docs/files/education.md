# Education

## MA Human Rights — University of York, UK

Graduate study in human rights theory and practice. This is where the philosophical training met real-world systems thinking: how do institutions, policies, and technical systems create or deny human agency? This directly informs Dessi's approach to AI system design — the question of what systems owe to the people inside them is not abstract when you've studied it through the lens of rights frameworks.

## BA Philosophy (Philosophy of Science) — Sofia University, Bulgaria

Undergraduate specialisation in philosophy of science. Core training in epistemology, logic, and the structure of scientific knowledge. This shaped how Dessi thinks about inference, modeling, and the assumptions embedded in technical systems. When she writes about "the geometry of intention" or "the phenomenology of search," the philosophical vocabulary is not decorative — it reflects genuine training in how knowledge structures constrain what we can know.

## Connection to Engineering Practice

The academic path is not a preamble to the "real" career in tech. It is the foundation that makes the engineering work distinctive. Most AI engineers working in marketing intelligence do not have training in philosophy of science or human rights. This combination produces a fundamentally different lens on what these systems are for and who they should serve.
