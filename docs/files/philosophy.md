# Empowerment Over Extraction

This is the central design thesis that runs through all of Dessi's work. It is both a philosophical position and an engineering constraint.

## The Thesis

AI systems, particularly in marketing and advertising, are overwhelmingly designed to extract: attention, data, behavioral surplus, decision-making autonomy. The dominant paradigm treats humans as targets to be optimized against.

Dessi's work asks a different question: what if the same technical capabilities — behavioral modeling, intent recognition, agent orchestration — were designed to *empower* the people they interact with? Not as a feel-good overlay, but as a fundamental architectural decision that changes what you build and how.

## How It Manifests in Practice

**In system design**: The Intent Recognition Agent doesn't just predict what users will do so advertisers can intercept them. It models intention as a rich geometric structure that could, in principle, help users understand their own behavioral patterns.

**In research writing**: Articles like "The Geometry of Intention" and "The Phenomenology of Search" don't just report technical findings — they interrogate the assumptions embedded in how marketing intelligence systems frame human behavior.

**In open-source work**: The AI Agent Skills Framework is designed to help marketing teams *adopt and understand* AI agents, not to create black-box dependencies. The educational architecture (guides, skill catalog, progressive complexity) is deliberate.

**In this portfolio itself**: DG-Labs OS presents information as a cognitive operating system — not because it's a clever UI trick, but because it reframes the portfolio from "look at my credentials" to "explore how I think." That reframing is an instance of the same thesis: empower the visitor's agency in navigating the information.

## Philosophical Roots

This isn't a position Dessi arrived at from within tech. It comes from:

- **Philosophy of science** (Sofia University): how knowledge structures shape what we can know and what we overlook
- **Human rights** (University of York): how systems create or deny agency, and the ethical obligations of system designers
- **Working inside the attention economy**: seeing firsthand how marketing intelligence systems are architected, and recognizing that the same capabilities could serve different ends
