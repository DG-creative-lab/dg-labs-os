# AI Agent Skills Framework

**Classification**: Open-source ecosystem project
**Status**: Active / public
**Organisation**: ai-knowledge-hub (GitHub org)

## What It Is

An open-source ecosystem designed to help marketing teams adopt AI agents through structured, progressive learning. It includes 18 production-ready skills, a Go CLI tool for skill management, a Next.js catalog website, and educational guides that build understanding from fundamentals to advanced orchestration.

## Architecture

### Skill Catalog
18 production skills documented with consistent structure: what the skill does, when to use it, inputs/outputs, implementation guidance, and difficulty rating. Skills are organised by domain and complexity level.

### Go CLI Tool
A command-line tool for discovering, installing, and managing AI agent skills. Built in Go for cross-platform compatibility and fast execution. Demonstrates infrastructure thinking — this isn't just content, it's tooling.

### Next.js Catalog Website
A browseable, searchable interface for the skill catalog. Deployed and public. Provides a visual complement to the CLI for teams that prefer GUI interaction.

### Educational Architecture
Progressive guides that build from "what is an AI agent" to "how to orchestrate multi-agent workflows." The educational design is deliberate — it's structured to build genuine understanding, not just provide recipes.

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates ecosystem-level thinking. It's not a single tool or library — it's a complete adoption system (CLI + catalog + guides + skills) designed to help teams move from "we should use AI agents" to actually running them in production. The educational architecture specifically reflects the empowerment thesis: give people understanding, not just tools.

## Cross-Runtime Compatibility

Skills are designed to work across different agent runtimes and frameworks, avoiding vendor lock-in. This is an architectural decision rooted in the same philosophy of empowerment — teams should be able to use these skills with whatever runtime they choose.

## Technical Stack

Go (CLI), Next.js/React (catalog website), Markdown (educational content), multi-runtime skill specifications
