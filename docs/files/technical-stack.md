# Technical Stack & Skills

## Core Languages
- **Python**: Primary language for AI/ML systems, data pipelines, API development. Used across Intent Recognition Agent, Agentic Commerce Learning Loop, and general backend services.
- **Go**: CLI tooling and infrastructure. Built the AI Agent Skills Framework CLI in Go for cross-platform distribution and performance.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Frontend and full-stack applications. Next.js (Skills Platform), React (DG-Labs OS components), Astro (AI News Hub).
- **R**: Earlier career analytics and data visualisation work. Foundation for statistical thinking that later informed Bayesian system design.

## Frameworks & Tools
- **FastAPI**: Python API development for production services
- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework (Skills Platform catalog)
- **Astro**: Content-focused static sites (AI News Hub)
- **React**: UI components (DG-Labs OS desktop/mobile shells)
- **Sigma.js**: Graph visualisation (Network knowledge graph)

## Infrastructure & Deployment
- **AWS**: Production deployment of enterprise systems. Multi-tenant architecture, service design, operational infrastructure.
- **Vercel**: Frontend deployments (portfolio, catalog sites)
- **Supabase**: Database and auth services
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines, automated testing

## AI & ML
- **Behavioral embeddings**: Vector representations of user behavior
- **Clustering algorithms**: Unsupervised discovery of intent patterns
- **Bayesian inference**: Progressive belief updating in learning systems
- **LLM integration**: Persona generation, natural language interfaces, retrieval-grounded responses
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Agent coordination, skill systems, learning loops
- **OpenRouter**: LLM API routing for agent runtime

## Development Approach
Dessi uses AI coding agents for frontend development (Next.js, React, Node.js), which she treats as a modern development workflow that provides velocity advantages. She maintains deep technical ownership of AI system architecture, backend services, and algorithm design — the AI-assisted work is in the UI layer, not the core intelligence.
