# The Geometry of Intention

**Type**: Deep Dive Analysis (published on AI News Hub)
**Status**: Published

## Core Argument

Consumer intent is conventionally treated as a classification problem: map a query or behavior to one of N predefined categories. This research piece argues that intent has *geometric* structure — it exists in a continuous space where proximity, direction, and clustering encode meaningful relationships that categorical taxonomies destroy.

## Key Ideas

**Intent as vector, not label**: When behavioral signals are embedded in continuous space, intent becomes something you can measure distances between, cluster, and decompose — rather than something you assign a label to.

**Emergent categories vs imposed taxonomies**: Traditional intent taxonomies (navigational, informational, transactional) are imposed from outside. Geometric modeling lets intent categories emerge from behavioral data, which often reveals structures that no human taxonomist would have designed.

**Philosophical grounding**: The piece draws explicitly on philosophy of science — specifically, how the choice of representational framework (categorical vs geometric) constrains what phenomena you can observe. This is not just a technical argument; it's an epistemological one.

## Connection to Engineering

This research directly informed the architecture of the Intent Recognition Agent. The four-layer system (embed → cluster → generate → interface) is the engineering implementation of the ideas in this piece. The research came first; the system made it real.

## Why It Matters for the Field

Most writing about marketing intent is either purely technical (here's how to build a classifier) or purely strategic (here's how to think about customer journeys). This piece bridges the two by showing how the philosophical question (what *is* intent?) leads to better engineering decisions.
