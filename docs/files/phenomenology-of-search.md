# The Phenomenology of Search

**Type**: Deep Dive Analysis (published on AI News Hub)
**Status**: Published

## Core Argument

Search behavior is typically analysed from the outside: click-through rates, query patterns, session metrics. This piece applies phenomenological methods to ask: what is the *experience* of searching? What does the act of formulating a query reveal about the searcher's state of mind, uncertainty, and intention?

## Key Ideas

**Search as disclosure**: Every search query is a moment where a person articulates what they don't know. The structure of that articulation — its specificity, its vocabulary, its refinements — reveals something about the phenomenology of not-knowing.

**The gap between query and intent**: Phenomenological analysis reveals that search queries are heavily compressed representations of much richer intentional states. Systems that treat the query as the intent are systematically misunderstanding what people are doing.

**Implications for system design**: If search is a phenomenological act (not just an information retrieval event), then systems should be designed to *understand and support* the experience of searching, not just to return results.

## Philosophical Method

The piece draws on phenomenological tradition (studying the structure of experience as it is lived) and applies it to a domain that is usually analysed purely quantitatively. This is enabled by Dessi's training in philosophy of science — the methodological vocabulary is not borrowed; it's native.

## Connection to Practice

This research complements "The Geometry of Intention" — where that piece asks about the *structure* of intent, this one asks about the *experience* of expressing it. Together, they form a two-sided argument for rethinking how marketing intelligence systems model human behavior.
