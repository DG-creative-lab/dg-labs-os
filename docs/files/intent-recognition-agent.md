# Intent Recognition Agent

**Classification**: Flagship system — long-term research and delivery project
**Status**: Production / active development
**Built at**: Performics Innovations Lab (Publicis Media)

## What It Is

A four-layer marketing intelligence system that models consumer intention through behavioral embeddings, clustering, and LLM-powered persona generation. Unlike standard intent classifiers that map queries to predefined categories, this system treats intention as a rich, multi-dimensional structure that can be decomposed geometrically.

## Architecture (Four Layers)

### Layer 1: Behavioral Embedding
Raw behavioral signals (search queries, browsing patterns, commerce actions) are embedded into a continuous vector space. This creates a geometric representation of behavior where proximity encodes similarity of intent, not just surface-level keyword overlap.

### Layer 2: Intent Clustering
The embedding space is clustered to discover natural groupings of intentional behavior. These clusters represent emergent intent categories — they are discovered from data, not predefined by taxonomies. This is where the "geometry of intention" thesis becomes operational.

### Layer 3: Persona Generation
LLM-powered synthesis of cluster characteristics into human-readable persona descriptions. Each persona is grounded in the behavioral data that defines its cluster, not hallucinated from demographic assumptions.

### Layer 4: Intelligence Interface
The output layer that makes intent intelligence actionable — connecting discovered intent patterns to campaign strategy, audience targeting, and content recommendations.

## Why This Matters

Most marketing intelligence systems treat intent as a classification problem: map a query to a bucket. This system treats intent as a *modeling* problem: represent the full structure of intentional behavior and let patterns emerge. The difference is architectural, not cosmetic — it changes what questions you can ask and what insights are possible.

## Technical Stack

Python, behavioral embeddings, clustering algorithms, LLM integration (persona generation), production deployment

## Connection to Research

This system is the engineering instantiation of ideas explored in "The Geometry of Intention" research piece. The philosophical question (what is the structure of intention?) became an architectural decision (embed behavior geometrically and let intent structure emerge from data).
