# Research Themes

Seven interconnected research threads run through Dessi's work. These are not isolated topics — they are idea-edges that connect projects, publications, and systems to each other.

## 1. Intent & Behavior Understanding

How do we model what people want? Not as classification into predefined categories, but as rich, structured representations of intentional behavior. This thread connects the Intent Recognition Agent (engineering), "The Geometry of Intention" (research), and the behavioral embedding architecture (technical method).

## 2. Agent Architecture & Orchestration

How do we build AI agents that genuinely learn and collaborate? Not just chains of LLM calls, but systems with beliefs, update mechanisms, and coordination protocols. This thread connects the Agentic Commerce Learning Loop and the AI Agent Skills Framework.

## 3. Open Source Infrastructure

How do we make AI capabilities accessible to teams that aren't building from scratch? This thread connects the Skills Framework (ecosystem), Go CLI tooling (developer experience), and the educational architecture (progressive learning).

## 4. Marketing Intelligence

How do we make marketing systems smarter without making them more extractive? This thread runs through all the Performics work — turning commercial problems into research questions about behavior, intent, and learning.

## 5. Human Agency & Empowerment

The meta-thread. How do we build systems that serve people rather than optimise against them? This connects everything — from architectural decisions to research writing to the portfolio itself.

## 6. Data Visualization & Representation

How do we represent complex information structures (career, knowledge, ideas) in ways that empower exploration? This connects the Network graph, DG-Labs OS design, and earlier R-based analytics work.

## 7. Learning Systems & Bayesian Methods

How do we build systems that genuinely learn over time with well-calibrated uncertainty? This connects the Agentic Commerce Learning Loop and broader interest in probabilistic methods for intelligent systems.

## Shadow Thread: AWS & System Design

Enterprise infrastructure patterns (multi-tenant, production deployment, AWS services) form a supporting layer across projects. This work hasn't been open-sourced but represents significant real-world engineering depth.
