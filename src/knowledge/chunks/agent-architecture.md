# Agent Architecture & Multi-Agent Systems

## Depth of Expertise

Dessi doesn't just use AI agents — she designs the architectures they run on. This spans three levels:

### System Architecture

Designing multi-agent systems with proper coordination, isolation, and learning mechanisms. The Agentic Commerce Learning Loop is the clearest example: agents with Bayesian beliefs, multi-tenant isolation, progressive learning, and closed feedback loops. This is genuine systems engineering, not prompt chaining.

### Skill & Capability Design

The AI Agent Skills Framework demonstrates understanding of how to decompose agent capabilities into modular, composable skills. 18 production skills with consistent interfaces, progressive complexity, and cross-runtime compatibility.

### Orchestration Patterns

Experience with coordinating multiple agents that need to share information, respect boundaries, and produce coherent outputs. This includes both the technical patterns (message passing, state management, conflict resolution) and the architectural decisions (when to decompose vs. centralise, how to handle cascading failures).

## What Distinguishes This from "Uses AI Agents"

Many engineers have experience _calling_ LLM APIs or _using_ agent frameworks. Dessi's work is at the _architecture_ level — designing the systems that agents run inside. The difference is between someone who drives a car and someone who designs engines.

Specific signals:

- Multi-tenant architecture with proper isolation (not just API wrappers)
- Bayesian learning mechanisms (not just prompt engineering)
- Skill modularity and ecosystem design (not just individual tools)
- 124+ commits on a single learning system (not prototypes)

## Relevance to Current AI Landscape

As LLM-powered agents become central to software architecture, the ability to design robust, production-grade agent systems — not just demonstrations — is becoming a critical engineering skill. Dessi has been doing this work before "agentic AI" became a buzzword.
