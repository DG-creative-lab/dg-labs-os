# Dessi Georgieva

Research Engineer working on AI systems and human agency. Currently positioned as Data Engineer at Performics Innovations Lab (Publicis Media), London — but the actual work is research-grade engineering on intelligent systems that sit at the intersection of marketing intelligence, agent architecture, and human empowerment.

Dessi builds AI systems that empower human agency rather than extract attention. This is not a tagline — it is a design constraint that runs through every project, from multi-agent orchestration systems to published research on how search intent encodes human phenomenology.

## Background

Dessi's path is non-linear by design. A BA in Philosophy (specialising in philosophy of science) from Sofia University trained her to think about the structure of knowledge and inference. An MA in Human Rights from University of York grounded that thinking in the real-world stakes of systems that affect people. The move into engineering was not a career pivot — it was applying the same questions (what do systems owe to the people inside them?) with more powerful tools.

## What Makes This Profile Distinct

Three things are rarely found together in one engineer:

1. **Philosophical depth applied to system design** — not as decoration, but as architectural constraint. The Intent Recognition Agent doesn't just cluster behavior; it is grounded in a theory of intention as geometric structure.

2. **Full-stack AI system building** — from Bayesian learning loops to multi-agent orchestration to production deployment on AWS. Not just prototypes; production systems with real tenants.

3. **Community and research output** — 200+ organic followers on an AI content platform, 50+ published articles including research-grade deep dives, all built in six months alongside full-time engineering work.

## Current Focus

Actively seeking roles that match the actual scope of her work: Research Engineer at AI labs, Founding Engineer at AI startups, or Staff Engineer at companies building agent systems.
