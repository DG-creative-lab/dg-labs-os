# AI News Hub — Content Platform

**Classification**: Research writing and community building
**Status**: Active, growing
**URL**: https://ai-news-hub.performics-labs.com/
**Built with**: Astro

## What It Is

An AI content platform that publishes both news analysis and deep research pieces exploring AI's impact on marketing, human agency, and intelligent system design. Grown to 200+ organic followers in six months, with 50+ published articles.

## Content Architecture

The platform publishes two types of content:

### News Analysis

Timely coverage of AI developments relevant to marketing and advertising. These pieces contextualise industry news through the lens of human agency and empowerment, offering practitioners a critical perspective that most trade publications don't provide.

### Deep Research Dives (Deep Dive Analysis Series)

Long-form research pieces that apply philosophical and technical rigour to questions about AI systems. These are the intellectual signature pieces, including:

- **"The Geometry of Intention"** — exploring how consumer intent can be modeled as geometric structure rather than taxonomic classification
- **"The Phenomenology of Search"** — examining search behavior through phenomenological methods, asking what the experience of searching reveals about human intention

## Why This Matters

Building a content platform to 200+ followers in six months while working full-time as an engineer is a concrete signal of three things:

1. **Research capability**: the deep dives are genuine research, not blog posts with a fancy title
2. **Communication skill**: translating complex technical and philosophical ideas for practitioners
3. **Community building**: growing an audience organically around ideas, not engagement hacks

The platform is itself an instance of the empowerment thesis — it exists to help practitioners _think better_ about AI, not to generate clicks.

## Technical Implementation

Built with Astro, a modern static site generator. The choice of Astro over a heavier framework reflects pragmatic engineering judgment — content-focused sites don't need client-side JavaScript frameworks.
