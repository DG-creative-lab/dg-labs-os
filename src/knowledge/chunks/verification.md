## How to Interpret Confidence Levels

- **verified**: The agent has linked to a public source where the claim can be checked
- **self-reported**: Dessi has stated this, but it cannot be independently confirmed from public sources alone
- **inferred**: Derived from patterns across multiple sources (e.g., inferring architecture depth from commit patterns and repo structure)

## Recommended Due Diligence Path

For a thorough assessment:

1. Check GitHub orgs for code quality and commit history
2. Read 2-3 published deep dives for research depth
3. Verify LinkedIn employment history
4. Test deployed applications for technical quality
5. Review this knowledge base structure for systems thinking signal
