# Performics Innovations Lab — Publicis Media

**Title**: Data Engineer (actual scope: Research Engineer)
**Location**: London, UK
**Organisation**: Performics Innovations Lab, part of Publicis Media

## Role Context

The official title is Data Engineer, but the actual work involves designing and building AI systems from the ground up — multi-agent architectures, Bayesian learning frameworks, behavioral modeling systems, and marketing intelligence platforms. This gap between title and scope is one reason Dessi is seeking roles that match the research-grade nature of her contributions.

## Core Systems Built

### Intent Recognition Agent

A four-layer marketing intelligence system that models consumer intention through behavioral embeddings, clustering, and LLM-powered persona generation. This is not a standard analytics pipeline — it treats intent as a geometric structure that can be decomposed, clustered, and reasoned about. See: `project-intent-recognition` for full details.

### Agentic Commerce Learning Loop

A multi-tenant Bayesian learning system with 124+ commits that enables marketing agents to learn from commerce signals. Architecture includes progressive Bayesian updating, multi-tenant isolation, and feedback loops. See: `project-agentic-commerce` for full details.

## What This Experience Demonstrates

- Ability to design and build production AI systems end-to-end
- Enterprise architecture skills (multi-tenant, AWS deployment)
- Research-grade thinking applied to commercial problems
- Working within the attention economy while designing for empowerment
